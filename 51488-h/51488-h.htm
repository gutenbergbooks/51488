<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>


<p>The best poetry is always about the earth itself and all the strange
and lovely things that compose and inhabit it. When a 'great poet'
sets himself the task of some 'big theme' he needs only to hold, as
it were, a magnifying glass to the earth. We who are born and live
here like very much to imagine other worlds, and we have even mentally
constructed such another in which to exist after dying on this one; but
we were careful to make it a glorified version of our own earth, with
everything we most love here intensified and improved to the utmost
stretch of human imagination.</p>

<p>To each man his 'best poetry' is that which he is able most to enjoy.
The first object of poetry is to give pleasure. Pleasure is various,
but it cannot exist where the emotions or the imagination have not
been powerfully stirred. Whether it be called sensual or intellectual,
pleasure cannot be willed. It is impossible to feel happy because one
wants to feel happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> or sad because one wishes to feel sad. But such
bodily or mental conditions may be induced from outside through a
natural agency such as poetry, or music.</p>

<p>Now those dreary people who would maintain that poetry should deal
(some say exclusively) with what they call 'big themes,' or 'the
larger life', are merely advocating more use of the magnifying glass
as against intensive cultivation of the natural eye. The poet is
essentially he who examines carefully, and learns to know fully, every
detail of common life. He seeks to name in a variety of manners, and
to define, the objects about him, to compare them with other objects,
near or remote, and to find, for the mere sake of enjoyment, wonderful
varieties of description and comparison. When he imagines better places
than his earth, or invents gods, the impersonation and combination of
the fortunate qualities in man, he is then using the magnifying glass
with talent, occasionally with rare genius. But the poet who seeks,
without genius, to magnify is simply a fool who sees everything too
big, and boasts, in the loudest voice he can raise, of his diseased
eyesight.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities, or perhaps rather the essential quality, of
the lyrical poetry of to-day is a minute concentration on the objects
immediately near it and an anxious carefulness to describe these in
the most appropriate and satisfactory terms. Thus it is often accused
of a neglect to sublimate the emotions, and many critics have been at
pains to suggest that this affection for the nearest and that careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
description of natural events denotes a smallness of mental range. Be
it noted, however, that the eye which does not look too far often sees
most. It is remarkable that English lyrical poetry should have learnt
in this period of religious uncertainty to clasp itself at least to a
reality that cannot be questioned or doubted. So far its faith reaches.
It expresses a trustfulness in what it can definitely perceive, it
hardly ventures outside the circles of human daily experience, and
in this capacity it reveals an excellence of many kinds, sincerity
often, and, at worst, a playfulness which, if ephemeral, is amusing
at any rate to those whom it is intended to amuse, and appropriately
irritating to those whom it wants to annoy.</p>

<p>But the most noticeable characteristic of the verse of our present
moment is its dislike of the aloofness generally associated with
English poetry. About twice a century language consolidates: phrases
which were once soft and new harden with use; words once of a ringing
beauty become dry and hollow through excessive repetition. This state
of language is not much noticed by people who have no special use
for it beyond the expression of daily needs. Moreover, they make new
colloquial words for themselves as required without forethought or
difficulty. Poets, however, must consciously search for new words, and
a tired condition of their language is to them a great difficulty. The
Victorians were absolute spendthrifts of words: no vocabulary could
keep pace with their recklessness; they bequeathed a language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> almost
ruined for sentimental purposes&mdash;words and phrases had acquired either
such an aloofness that for a long time no one any more would trouble
to reach up to them, or had become so thin and common that to use them
would have been something like hack-sawing a piece of cotton.</p>

<p>Now in the anthology which follows we may notice a characteristic
escape from these difficulties. Words have been brought down from their
high places and compelled into ordinary use. This has been accomplished
not so much through any new familiarity with the words themselves as
by a certain naturalness in the attitude of the people employing them.
Rupert Brooke's "Great Lover" is an example.</p>

<p>In short, these are the chief reasons why present-day poetry is
readable and entertaining&mdash;that it deals with familiar subjects in a
familiar manner; that, in doing so, it uses ordinary words literally
and as often as possible; that it is not aloof or pretentious; that it
refuses to be bullied by tradition: its style, in fact, is itself.</p>



<h4>II</h4>


<p>If an excuse is to be sought for the addition of this one more to the
large number of existent collections of recent poetry, let it be in
the nature of an explanation rather than an apology. Good, or even
representative, poetry requires, in fact, no apology, but where the
poems of some thirty-two different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> authors have been extracted from
their books and placed side by side in one collection, a discussion
of the apparent aims of the anthologist may be interesting, and will
perhaps lead to a fuller enjoyment of the collection thus produced.</p>

<p>Some readers approach a volume of poems to criticize it, others with
the object of gaining pleasure. To give pleasure is assuredly the
object of this volume. Moreover, it is adapted to the tastes of almost
any age, from ten to ninety, and may be read aloud by grandchild to
grandparent as suitably as by grandparent to grandchild. It is an
anthology of Poems, not of Names. For instance, though Thomas Hardy
is on the list, the lyric chosen to represent him is actually more
characteristic of the book itself than of the mind of that great
and aged poet. It is, in fact, Christian in atmosphere. It is not a
typical specimen of Mr Hardy's style. It shows him in that occasional
rather sad mood of regret for a lost superstition. It is not the
best of Hardy, but rather a poem admirably suited to the book, which
also happens, as by chance, to be by the author of "The Dynasts" and
"Satires of Circumstance."</p>



<h4>III</h4>


<p>The collection as a whole is modern, and all except eight of its
authors are living and writing. Of those eight, five died as soldiers
in the European War, and are represented mainly by what is known as
'War poetry.' Otherwise such poetry is fortunately absent. This absence
may be justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> by the fact that most of the verse written on the
subject of the War turns out, surveyed in cooler blood, to be, as
any sound judge of literature must always have known, definitely and
unmistakably bad. Much of it is by now, or should be, repudiated by
its authors. It was too often "the spontaneous overflow of powerful
feelings"; it too seldom originated from "emotion recollected in
tranquillity."</p>

<p>Rupert Brooke's sonnets "The Dead" and "The Soldier" were popular
almost from their first publication. They belong undoubtedly to the
best traditions of English poetry. Julian Grenfell's "Into Battle,"
and, in a lesser, degree, the "Home Thoughts from Laventie" of Edward
Wyndham Tennant, have acquired popularity among a larger number of folk
than can be included in the general term 'literary circles.' Neither of
the composers of these verses was a professional poet. Both were men of
attractive personality and strong feeling, with education, taste, and
an occasional impulse to write gracefully. Intrinsically either poem
might as easily have been inspired by an Indian frontier raid as by a
European war. They do not affect the traditions of English poetry by
subject or by form. It will be found, as the years pass, that always
fewer 'War poems' can still be read with pleasure, the incidents which
gave rise to them having become dim in human memory. And these will not
be read because of their association with the Great War, but for their
qualities as poems and their power to stir enjoyment or surprise in the
reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider those four melancholy lines by which Edward Thomas is here
represented, remarkable for their concentration and for the crowd of
images they can suggest. At present the words "where all that passed
are dead" alone associate this poem with the War. But death comes
through so many causes that twenty years from now a footnote would be
needed if it were desired to emphasize that association.</p>

<p>J.E. Flecker's "Dying Patriot," one of his three poems in this book,
was written in 1914 in Switzerland, where he was dying of consumption.
It is certainly less a 'War poem' than the same author's "War Song of
the Saracens."</p>

<p>The verses entitled "A Petition," by R. E. Vernède, are of a different
kind. They are written in conventional Henley-Kiplingese, and contain
too many incidents of a type of poetic expression that has been used
to excess, as "wider than all seas," "to front the world," "quenchless
hope" "All that a man might ask thou hast given me, England!" They are,
nevertheless, useful in the collection as a set-off against the other
'War poems' and an instance of the more ephemeral type of patriotic
verse.</p>

<p>Thus it would appear that the anthologist has displayed wisdom when
including in this volume only few pieces that may be associated with
the War, and those few (with one exception) on the score of their
literary merit, and for no other reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>



<h4>IV</h4>


<p>Poets of to-day write individually less than their pre-decessors, and
most of them are satisfied to publish only a proportion of what they
write. None of the eight referred to above left us any great bulk of
verse. Four at least, however, are becoming daily better known to the
reading public, and of these Rupert Brooke and J. E. Flecker have
already their dozens of conscious or unconscious imitators. The form,
rhythm, or Eastern atmosphere of Fleckers poetry, the cynicism and
wit of Brooke's, recur somewhat diluted in the verse of almost every
young undergraduate. Neither Lionel Johnson nor Mary Coleridge has ever
become so well known or received so much attention from the average
plagiarist, while the reputation of Edward Thomas has been of slow and
uncertain growth. Johnsons poetry is too intellectual for the average
reader. The wonderful, small lyrics of Mary Coleridge are esoteric
rather than general. Nevertheless, this anthology includes, most
advisedly, a good poem by Johnson, one indeed which has had a quiet,
but strong, influence on modern lyrical poetry, namely, the lines
to the statue of King Charles at Charing Cross, and also a charming
impression by Mary Coleridge.</p>

<p>"Street Lanterns" is a good example of that poetry of close observation
to which reference has already been made. It is a small, careful
description of a London scene. It assumes that the reader has observed
as much, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> will enjoy to be reminded and brought back for
a moment in imagination to autumn and street-mending. The advocate of
'big themes' will inevitably condemn such verse, for the poet has aimed
at neither size nor grandeur, has indeed sought rather to diminish her
subject than enlarge it.</p>



<h4>V</h4>


<p>This anthology, it has been remarked above, is one rather of particular
poems than of well-known authors. Several names of repute are not to
be found in the index. William Watson is only represented by "April,"
a little catch that might come to any man of feeling on a spring walk.
To think in terms of these verses is at once not to mind having left
an umbrella at home. Hilaire Belloc gives a sharp impression of early
rising; he also sings in a great voice all the glories of his favourite
part of England. W. H. Davies brings sheep across the Atlantic, and
he talks to a kingfisher. Mrs Meynell contributes "The Shepherdess,"
that well-known description of a fine and serene mind, also two London
poems, of which one is the lovely "November Blue." John Masefield is
not to be read in his best style, but the three poems we find here are
thoroughly English, full of the love of the island soil and of its sea,
and are probably in the book for that reason. So much for some of the
well-known contributors. Side by side with them we find the unknown
name of H. H. Abbott, whose "Black and White" is a sketch of remarkable
clarity and interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Death, so favourite a subject with poets, is seldom allowed to figure
in this book. Betsey-Jane would insist on going to Heaven, but is told,
in the charming verses by Helen Parry Eden, that it simply "would not
do." The whole book is too full of pleasure and the experience of being
alive: Betsey-Jane should read it. She might remember all her life the
advice given on page <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, and be saved hundreds of pounds in lawyers'
bills when she is grown up.</p>

<p>Let the reader turn to page <a href="#Page_114">114</a>. Here is the style in which good poetry
prefers to teach, and by which it achieves more in eleven lines than a
Martin Tupper in 11,000. Mr Pepler has written down only one sentence,
charmingly improved by a series of most natural rhymes. It is a very
nasty hit at the lawyer. He does not tell him he is not a 'gentleman',
or anything so strong as that. He pays him what might be taken for a
compliment. He assumes that he does understand his own job. Then he
enumerates the things he does not understand. He attaches no blame: he
makes a statement only; one that the lawyer certainly will not think
worth arguing about, but that his client may advisedly take to heart.</p>

<p>Ralph Hodgson's "Stupidity Street" argues in somewhat the same manner.
It does not suggest that anyone should become vegetarian, or that it is
wrong to kill birds. It names a street and gives a reason for doing so.
It is an angry little Poem, but impersonal.</p>

<p>"The Bells of Heaven," by the same author, simply chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> a hint that
something might happen if something else did. It is a suggestion only,
but made by one who knows what he thinks, and how to think it. Into a
few lines a whole philosophy is concentrated.</p>

<p>Thus Pepler or Ralph Hodgson nudge peoples arms and draw attention to
traditional stupidities.</p>

<p>Walter De la Mare puts the children to sleep with "Nod," or bewitches
them with the Mad Prince's Song; or he takes us to an Arabia which
never existed, but is one of those countries more beautiful than any we
know, and therefore we love to imagine it.</p>

<p>Look at that full moon on page <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, which Dick saw "one night." Here is
the possible experience of man, woman, child, dog, fox, bear&mdash;or even
nightingale&mdash;all concentrated into the shortest and plainest account
of something that happened to Dick. He and Betsey-Jane, though quite
different in kind, belong to the same world. Betsey-Jane is plainly
more romantic than Dick.</p>

<p>But, talking of the moon, we may turn back to Mr Chesterton on page
<a href="#Page_36">36</a>. Here we find something incongruous in the collection: a poem
that wishes deliberately to strike a note. The donkey is a much
better fellow than Mr Chesterton seems to think: he does not ask for
glorification, nor would he utter that boast of the last two lines.
Would a man not rather "go with the wild asses to Paradise" than have
the case for the donkey pleaded before him in this obtrusive manner?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Turn back four pages and you will find:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
For the good are always the merry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save by an evil chance,</span><br />
And the merry love the fiddle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the merry love to dance.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This, by W. B. Yeats, represents a much pleasanter type of thought. In
these verses of the Irish poet we have the gaiety of a man who, knowing
all about religion, can afford not to be sentimental. And here is the
spirit of the book.</p>

<p>The happiness of those who love the earth is so different from the
pleasure by proxy of those that abide it in the idea of going to some
Heaven afterward. Mr Yeats' "Fiddler of Dooney" is that type of fellow
who accepts the symbolism of a national religion only in so far as it
may help him to enjoy the condition of being alive. And in his "Lake
Isle of Innisfree" he imagines a Paradise which is of the earth only.
And he takes you there by reason of his own longing.</p>



<h4>VI</h4>


<p>This anthology, as a whole, is romantic ; its language is simple; its
philosophy is that of everyday life, and is entirely undisturbing.
It contains a large proportion of poems by authors who write more
particularly for children, such as P. R. Chalmers, Rose Fyleman,
Queenie Scott-Hopper, and Marion St John Webb, or of children's poems
by authors who do not actually specialize in that style, such as "The
Ragwort,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> by Frances Cornford; "Cradle Song," by Sarojini Naidu;
"Check," by James Stephens, and others. Two of its authors remain
necessarily unmentioned here, namely, the compiler of the book and the
writer of this Introduction.</p>

<p>Some people make it their business to pick anthologies to pieces,
and they seem to enjoy themselves. "Why is this included?" they cry;
"Why is that left out?"&mdash;a form of criticism nearly always beside the
point. Inclusion or exclusion is in the taste and discretion of the
anthologist.</p>

<p>This Introduction may, it is hoped, stimulate the reader of the poems
which follow to think about them carefully in their relation to
each other, and in their relation to English poetry as a whole. For
though it has frequently been emphasized that the object of poetry
(and particularly of lyrical poetry) is to give pleasure, it should
nevertheless be added that intellectual pleasure cannot be gathered at
random, or without certain preparation of the mind to receive it.</p>

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,<br />
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;<br />
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And live alone in the bee-loud glade.</span><br />
<br />
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,<br />
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;<br />
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And evening full of the linnet's wings.</span><br />
<br />
I will arise and go now, for always, night and day,<br />
I hear lake-water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br />
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,<br />

<span class="caption">THE SOUTH COUNTRY</span>
<br />
<br />
When I am living in the Midlands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That are sodden and unkind,</span><br />
I light my lamp in the evening:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My work is left behind;</span><br />
And the great hills of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come back into my mind.</span><br />
<br />
The great hills of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stand along the sea;</span><br />
And it's there walking in the high woods<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I could wish to be,</span><br />
And the men that were boys when I was a boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walking along with me.</span><br />
<br />
The men that live in North England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw them for a day:</span><br />
Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their skies are fast and grey;</span><br />
From their castle-walls a man may see<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mountains far away.</span><br />
<br />
The men that live in West England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They see the Severn strong,</span><br />
A-rolling on rough water brown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Light aspen leaves along.</span><br />
They have the secret of the Rocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the oldest kind of song.</span><br />
<br />
But the men that live in the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the kindest and most wise,</span><br />
They get their laughter from the loud surf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the faith in their happy eyes</span><br />
Comes surely from our Sister the Spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When over the sea she flies;</span><br />
The violets suddenly bloom, at her feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She blesses us with surprise.</span><br />
<br />
I never get between the pines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I smell the Sussex air;</span><br />
Nor I never come on a belt of sand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my home is there.</span><br />
And along the sky the line of the Downs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So noble and so bare.</span><br />
<br />
A lost thing could I never find,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor a broken thing mend:</span><br />
And I fear I shall be all alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I get towards the end.</span><br />
Who will be there to comfort me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or who will be my friend?</span><br />
<br />
I will gather and carefully make my friends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the men of the Sussex Weald,</span><br />
They watch the stars from silent folds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stiffly plough the field.</span><br />
By them and the God of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My poor soul shall be healed.</span><br />
<br />
If I ever become a rich man,<br />

To hear the wild bees and see the merry spring again.<br />

Larks are singing in the west, brother, above the green wheat,<br />
So will you not come home, brother, and rest your tired feet?<br />

<span class="caption">THE GREAT LOVER</span>
<br />
<br />
I have been so great a lover: filled my days<br />
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,<br />
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,<br />
Desire illimitable, and still content,<br />
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,<br />
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear<br />
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.<br />
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife<br />
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,<br />
My night shall be remembered for a star<br />
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.<br />
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise<br />
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me<br />
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see<br />
The inenarrable godhead of delight?<br />
Love is a flame;&mdash;we have beaconed the world's night.<br />
A city:&mdash;and we have built it, these and I.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>An emperor:&mdash;we have taught the world to die.<br />
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,<br />
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,<br />
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names<br />
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,<br />
And set them as a banner, that men may know,<br />
To dare the generations, burn, and blow<br />
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming....<br />
These I have loved:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,</span><br />
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;<br />
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust<br />
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;<br />
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;<br />
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;<br />
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,<br />
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;<br />
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon<br />
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss<br />
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is<br />
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen<br />
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;<br />
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;<br />
The good smell of old clothes; and other such&mdash;<br />
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,<br />
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers<br />
About dead leaves and last year's ferns....<br />

<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">Dear names,</span><br />
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;<br />
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;<br />
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;<br />
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,<br />
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;<br />
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam<br />
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;<br />
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold<br />
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;<br />
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;<br />
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;&mdash;<br />
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;&mdash;<br />
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass.<br />
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,<br />
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power<br />
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.<br />
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,<br />
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust<br />
And sacramented covenant to the dust.<br />
&mdash;Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
And give what's left of love again, and make<br />
New friends, now strangers....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">But the best I've known,</span><br />
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown<br />
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains<br />
Of living men, and dies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Nothing remains.</span><br />
<br />
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again<br />
This one last gift I give: that after men<br />
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,<br />
Praise you, "All these were lovely"; say, "He loved."<br />

An' beside him on the splashboard sat a brindled tarrier pup,<br />

Was joggin' in the dust along is roundabouts and swings.<br />

When I was once in Baltimore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A man came up to me and cried,</span><br />
"Come, I have eighteen hundred sheep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we will sail on Tuesday's tide.</span><br />
<br />
"If you will sail with me, young man,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Baltimore to Glasgow town."</span><br />
<br />
He paid me fifty shillings down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sailed with eighteen hundred sheep;</span><br />
We soon had cleared the harbour's mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We soon were in the salt sea deep.</span><br />
<br />
The first night we were out at sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those sheep were quiet in their mind;</span><br />
The second night they cried with fear&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They smelt no pastures in the wind.</span><br />
<br />
They sniffed, poor things, for their green fields,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They cried so loud I could not sleep:</span><br />
For fifty thousand shillings down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would not sail again with sheep.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where the mud is churned and splashed about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">By battle-wending feet;</span><br />
And yet beside one stricken house there is a glimpse of grass,<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Beyond the Church whose pitted spire</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Two roofless ruins stand,</span><br />
And here behind the wreckage where the back-wall should have been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We found a garden green.</span><br />

Along its weedy surface, but the nimble-footed mouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Running from house to house.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">So all among the vivid blades</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Of soft and tender grass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">We lay, nor heard the limber wheels</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">That pass and ever pass,</span><br />
In noisy continuity, until their stony rattle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Seems in itself a battle.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">At length we rose up from our ease</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Of tranquil happy mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And searched the garden's little length</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">A fresh pleasaunce to find;</span><br />
And there, some yellow daffodils and jasmine hanging high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Did rest the tired eye.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The fairest and most fragrant</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Of the many sweets we found,</span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Upon a grassy mound,</span><br />
And so thick were the blossoms set, and so divine the scent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That we were well content.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hungry for Spring I bent my head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The perfume fanned my face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And all my soul was dancing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">In that lovely little place,</span><br />
Dancing with a measured step from wrecked and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">shattered towns</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Away . . . upon the Downs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I saw green banks of daffodil,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Great tan-brown hares in gusty March</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">A-courting on the leas;</span><br />

With busy fingers spilling baby-leaves<br />
On all the bushes, and a faint green down<br />
On ancient trees, and everywhere<br />
Your warm breath soft with kisses<br />
Stirs the wintry air,<br />
And waking us to unimagined blisses.<br />
Your lightest footprints in the grass<br />
Are marked by painted crocus-flowers<br />
And heavy-headed daffodils,<br />
While little trees blush faintly as you pass.<br />
The morning and the night<br />
You bathe with heavenly showers,<br />
And scatter scentless violets on the rounded hills,<br />
Drop beneath leafless woods pale primrose posies.<br />
With magic key, in the new evening light,<br />

I don't like beetles, tho' I'm sure they're very good,<br />

I don't like the cistern in the attic where I play,<br />

I wish I liked rice pudding,<br />

I wish some day a real live fairy<br />
Would just come walking in.<br />

I wish when I'm at table<br />
My feet would touch the floor,<br />

I wish that I could whistle<br />
Real proper grown-up tunes,<br />
I wish they'd let me sweep the chimneys<br />

I've got such heaps of wishes,<br />

We would not hurt them, he knows; not we!<br />

No thrush was ever so proud as he!<br />

An iron thunder&mdash;grows, and roars, and sweeps,<br />

Suddenly leaps,<br />
Startled, from its repose&mdash;<br />
Alert and listening. Now, from the gloom<br />
Of the soft distance, loom<br />
Three lights and, over them, a brush<br />
Of tawny flame and flying spark&mdash;<br />
Three pointed lights that rush,<br />
Monstrous, upon the cringing dark.<br />
<br />
And nearer, nearer rolls the sound,<br />
Louder the throb and roar of wheels,<br />
The shout of speed, the shriek of steam;<br />
The sloping bank,<br />

<br />
And grind of metal, while the ground<br />
Shudders and the bridge reels&mdash;<br />
As, with a scream,<br />
The train,<br />
A rage of smoke, a laugh of fire,<br />
A lighted anguish of desire,<br />
A dream<br />
Of gold and iron, of sound and flight,<br />
Tumultuous roars across the night.<br />
<br />
The train roars past&mdash;and, with a cry,<br />
Drowned in a flying howl of wind,<br />
Half-stifled in the smoke and blind,<br />
The plain,<br />
Shaken, exultant, unconfined,<br />
Rises, flows on, and follows, and sweeps by,<br />
Shrieking, to lose itself in distance and the sky.<br />
